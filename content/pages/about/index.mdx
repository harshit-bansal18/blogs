Hi!

I'm Harshit Bansal, Undergraduate Sophomore in Computer Science and Engineering Department at IIT Kanpur. I am passionate about Cybersecurity, especially Network and System Security. I spend my time doing pentesting on HackTheBox, VulnHub and TryHackMe. I started my blog to publish my writeups on machines I have solved and other interesting stuff!
